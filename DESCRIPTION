Description: Uniform random samples from simple manifolds, sometimes with noise,
    are commonly used to test topological data analytic (TDA) tools.
    This package includes samplers powered by two techniques: analytic
    volume-preserving parameterizations, as employed by Arvo (1995)
    <doi:10.1145/218380.218500>, and rejection sampling, as employed by
    Diaconis, Holmes, and Shahshahani (2013) <doi:10.1214/12-IMSCOLL1006>.
